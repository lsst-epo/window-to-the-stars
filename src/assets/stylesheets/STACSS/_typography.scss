// Component Typography and Prototypes
// -----------------------------------

// Template typography mixins/prototypes and utility classes that can be extended into content classes.
// Typographic classes can contain some structural (not textural) design where it does not require abstraction,
// and textural classes dealing with typography (color, text-decoration, pseudo elements that modify text, etc).

// They may contain:
// Nested classes or elements with typographic/basic structural modifications only, for instance a header
// with <span> classes inside.

// These should not contain classes/prototypes to handle icon fonts. Those should be handles in a separate icons partial.
